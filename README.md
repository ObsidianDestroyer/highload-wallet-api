## Source code

You can always get the source code from the github repository page:

https://github.com/tonuniverse/highload-wallet-api

## Getting started

First, you need to compile the FunC and Fift needed to create the wallet and interact with it. The easiest way to do this is to install `mytonctrl` in `lite` mode from https://github.com/igroman787/mytonctrl

Fift will be built automatically after `mytonctrl` installation. Now do the following to build the FunC:

- `cd /usr/bin/ton/`
- `make func`
